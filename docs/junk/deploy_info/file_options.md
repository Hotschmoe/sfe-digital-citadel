   - External storage support

### Test Environment Requirements
```yaml
# Example docker-compose for testing
version: '3.8'

services:
  nextcloud:
    image: nextcloud:latest
    volumes:
      - nextcloud_data:/var/www/html
    environment:
      - NEXTCLOUD_ADMIN_USER=admin
      - NEXTCLOUD_ADMIN_PASSWORD=testing123

  seafile:
    image: seafileltd/seafile-mc:latest
    volumes:
      - seafile_data:/shared
    environment:
      - SEAFILE_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
      - SEAFILE_ADMIN_PASSWORD=testing123

  filerun:
    image: afian/filerun:latest
    volumes:
      - filerun_data:/var/www/html/userfiles
    environment:
      - FR_DB_HOST=db
      - FR_DB_USER=filerun
```

### Migration Considerations
1. **Data Migration**
   - File structure preservation
   - Metadata retention
   - User permissions
   - Share links

2. **User Experience**
   - Client software availability
   - Mobile app quality
   - Web interface usability
   - Learning curve

3. **Integration with Other Services**
   - Matrix/Element integration
   - WikiJS document linking
   - Backup system compatibility
   - SSO implementation

## Current Recommendation
Continue with Nextcloud for now, but set up test environment for:
1. OCIS (as potential future upgrade path)
2. Seafile (as high-performance alternative)
3. FileBrowser (as lightweight backup option)

### Testing Schedule
1. Week 1-2: Basic deployment and performance testing
2. Week 3-4: Integration testing with other services
3. Week 5-6: User testing and feedback
4. Week 7-8: Migration testing and documentation

### Decision Matrix
| Solution   | Performance | Features | Integration | Maintenance | Total |
|------------|------------|----------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| Nextcloud  | 7/10       | 9/10     | 9/10        | 7/10       | 32/40  |
| OCIS       | 9/10       | 7/10     | 8/10        | 6/10       | 30/40  |
| Seafile    | 9/10       | 7/10     | 6/10        | 8/10       | 30/40  |
| FileRun    | 8/10       | 6/10     | 5/10        | 8/10       | 27/40  |
| FileBrowser| 9/10       | 4/10     | 4/10        | 9/10       | 26/40  |

Note: Scores are preliminary and should be validated through testing.
